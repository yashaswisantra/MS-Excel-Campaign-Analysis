Analysis of a Campaign

Here I have tried to do a analysis of Champaign by applying some pie, bar and combo charts and tried to show the relationship between education category and job category. Also shown the percentage of woman education and the outcome of total champaigns VS previous champaigns. I added some slicer to make the analysis easy.
