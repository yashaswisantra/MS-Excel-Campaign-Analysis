# Analysis of a Campaign

Here I have tried to do a analysis of Champaign by applying some pie, bar and combo charts and tried to show the relationship between education category and job category. Also shown the percentage of woman education and the outcome of total champaigns VS previous champaigns. I added some slicer to make the analysis easy.

Here are some key insights from the analysis of the campaign data:

1) Job distribution: Blue-collar workers make up the largest segment (53%) of the campaign audience, followed by management (14%) and housemaids (12%).
2) Education levels: University degree holders are the most represented education category, followed by high school graduates.
3) Campaign performance: The campaign peaked in April with 1,573 outcomes, and had another significant spike in June with 2,193 outcomes. Overall campaign activity seems to decline in the latter half of the year.
4) Women's education: Married women have the highest rates of university degrees (17%) and professional courses (13%) compared to other marital statuses.
5) Marital status: The data includes information on divorced, married, and single individuals, with different educational patterns for each group.
6) Job categories: Admin (25%) and blue-collar (22%) jobs are the most common among the campaign audience.
7) Additional factors: The analysis includes data on loan status and housing, which could be relevant factors in the campaign's targeting or outcomes.
8) Seasonal trends: There appears to be higher campaign activity in spring and early summer months, with a drop-off later in the year.
